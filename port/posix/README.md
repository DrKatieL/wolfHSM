#Posix Port

The Posix port provides multiple and fully functional implementations of different wolfHSM abstractions that can be used to better understand the exact functionality expected for different hardware abstractions.

The Posix port provides:
- Memory buffer transport
- TCP transport
- Unix domain transport
- NVM device (using a filesystem)
- Flash device (using a file as a backing store)
